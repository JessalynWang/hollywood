Jessalyn Wang, jwang456

--Description--
In this assignment we implemented a graph that connects actors/actresses by movies they've worked on, and supports of the shortest path between actors.

--Files--
sixdegrees.cpp: implements the graph and handles path queries
Makefile: creates an executable, sixdegrees.cpp
README: this file

--Usage--
Run make, which will create an executable called sixdegrees
The executable takes an input file, where each line is <ACTOR1> <ACTOR2>, and writes to an output file
Run ./sixdegrees <INPUT FILE> <OUTPUT FILE>

NOTE: the cleaned movie list is not in this repp this project is WIP
